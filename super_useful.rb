# PHASE 3

# Overview
#
# Sometimes when an error is thrown we would like to try the failing operation again (hopefully with different input ðŸ˜‰). This is often the case with user input and text parsing. Let's try to make friendly monster happy by allowing us to retry feeding it a fruit when certain errors are thrown.
#
# Instructions
#
# Friendly monster is really friendly and really likes coffee, so he'd like to give us another try, but only when we give him "coffee".
#
# First, handle the errors being thrown by #reaction in #feed_me_a_fruit.
#
# Note that #reaction throws errors receiving an argument that is not in FRUITS. Next, let's differentiate the errors thrown so our calling function, #feed_me_a_fruit can try to feed friendly monster again, but only when they've given it coffee.
#
# Now that we have different error types being thrown by #reaction we can do a little conditional logic in #feed_me_a_fruit to retry the failing block of code again, but only if it is a coffee-related error.
#


FRUITS = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

def reaction(maybe_fruit)
  # begin
    if FRUITS.include?(maybe_fruit)

      puts "OMG, thanks so much for the #{maybe_fruit}!"

    else
      raise StandardError
    end
  rescue StandardError
    if maybe_fruit == "coffee"
      # feed_me_a_fruit
      puts "I do like coffee!! Try again"
      maybe_fruit = gets.chomp
      retry
    end
  # end

end

  puts "Hello, I am a friendly monster. :)"

  puts "Feed me a fruit! (Enter the name of a fruit:)"
